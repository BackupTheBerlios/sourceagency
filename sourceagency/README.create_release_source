This readme contains some notes about copying the files for making a release
tree. I.e. copying files from beta to htdocs directly.

The intention is to have a beta site .../htdocs/beta in which all changes
are first tested. Once all changes have been accepted, the files may be 
copied into the .../htdocs directory directory, thereby becoming a part of
the release site (i.e. http://sourceagency.berlios.de).

Before the files are copied, the CVS repository should be tagged so that 
all files in .../htdocs are part of a tagged release.

1. remove all CVS directories in the directories that were copied, e.g. in
   images, html, include, faq ... This is to prevent code from being committed
   from the htdocs directory.
2. Need to make a number of changes to specific files:
   - html/include/top_title.inc and include/top_title.inc:
     - need to remove the "BETA BETA BETA" table-square 
     - increase the width of the table-square before the BETA square to 99%
   - html/include/config.inc and include/config.inc:
     - $sys_url needs to be set sourceagency.berlios.de instead of 
	sourceagency.berlios.de/beta
